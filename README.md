## Description
We wanted to do something fun and create a free take on the  runner style game. There are many runner style games on the internet but none that featured emojis! The controls are very simple. To jump press the spacebar. As the player scores more points more enemies appear on screen. Since this game is never ending the goal is to survive as long as possible. Once the player has ran out of three lives the high score is logged into our database.
